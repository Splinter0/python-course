## What we will be doing today

Review of functions and objects alongside exercises

## Any questions?

## Function Problems:

1. Make a function that takes any number array and returns the product of all the integers in that array
2. Make a function that returns the average of the array
3. Make a function that deletes the last element of an array and returns the modified array.
4. Make a function that takes two arguments: weight in kg and height in cm. The function should calculate the BMI from that and return it.
5. Make a function that takes an array and a number (n). It should return the n first elements of the function. Beware of n longer than the array

## Object problems

1. Point object 
    1. Make an object that is a point with the coordinates x and y so that i can create a point by calling 
    ```python
    p = Point(2,3)
    ``` 
    such that 2 is the x coordinate
    2. Make a function that takes two points and returns the distance between them
2. Make an object called Human that holds qualities such as height, name, weight, and age. Make the constructor for that
