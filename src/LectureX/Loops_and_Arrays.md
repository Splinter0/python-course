## Introduction to Arrays
Arrays are another way to store data. In a nutshell, an array contains a series of 
variables that are ordered with numbers from 0 to some number (integer) $n$. 
Note that if you want to get the 1st element of an array, you must access the 0th element.
This is called **0-indexing**. 
A list can contain multiple different types of variables in Python but this is different
in other programming languages.

### Syntax of an Array
Some examples of arrays:
```python
some_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
some_array = [True, 23.21, "HI!"]
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd',]
```


## Introduction to Loops
Loops are dsabdsadjava fds fds
For example the following code snippet would print the numbers from 1 to 99 
on the screen.

```python
for i in range(0,100):
	print(i)
```
